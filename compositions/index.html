				<p>As a composer, I started out attempting to imitate Baroque, Classical, and eventually Romantic compositional styles, with MuseScore and Sibelius 7 as my weapons of choice. In the past few years, I've been experimenting with different genres ranging from chiptune to J-pop to symphonic metal. Most recently, I've been working on a few pieces that combine orchestra, guitars, synths, and choir while hearkening back to the structure and style of classic video game soundtracks.<p>

					<li>
						<p class="work-title">Thanatos Gambit</p>
						<p class="work-info">2016 (Abandoned)</p>
						<p class="work-desc">I wanted this piece to follow the structure of a track that someone might listen to on its own, with some subtler soundtrack-like elements included. I opted not to use any synths this time, preferring to focus on balancing the heavy metal and orchestral aspects so that neither felt unimportant. I like this composition a lot, but I have no intention of finishing it.</p>

						<p class="work-title">Nothung</p>
						<p class="work-info">2016 (Finished)</p>
						<p class="work-desc">When I started writing this piece, I wasn't exactly sure what kind of music I wanted to make; I had an idea and I just ran with it. Originally it was supposed to be more like a video game soundtrack, but about halfway in I wanted it to be a standalone piece, too. These ideas interacted and conflicted throughout the composition, and the result sounds to me like a curious but slightly confused fusion.</p>
