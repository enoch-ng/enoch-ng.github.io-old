			<h2>About</h2>
			<div id="content">
				<p>I'm Enoch. I like cats, music, mathematics, programming, writing, and ice cream. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's in computer science at the University of Texas at Dallas. As this page is a work in progress, no useful information will be provided.</p>
				<p>Because there's no real disadvantage to putting my plans for the website here, what I'm envisioning right now is eventually all the "works" (projects, compositions, arrangements, essays) will be browsable in those respective pages, and you'll probably hover over the listing you want, and if you click the list will go away and you'll have options for reading/hearing/obtaining the thing. One step at a time, though.</p>
				<p>Basic dropdown boxes have been partially implemented (you can test this by going to the home page and hovering over "Arrangements". However, it's also kind of ugly and pointless right now, so I'll refrain from improving on them for now. In particular, the font doesn't really fit, and the colors could use some tweaking.</p>
				<p>Animations would also be lovely.</p>
