		<h2>Regarding the Paradox of American Schooling</h2>
		<p><em>A heavily sarcastic essay I wrote in the twelfth grade regarding the self-defeating competitiveness of American public education, modeled loosely after Jonathan Swift’s infamous “A Modest Proposal”.</em></p>
		<p>The single most important issue with respect to our country’s status and future, let us agree, is the effective education of our young. No other political matter, nuclear disarmament of our enemies aside, so single-handedly determines our role in coming decades—for if our children are insufficiently educated now, how can they govern effectively in twenty years? As well is it among the most complex issues, for its success hinges not only on the actions of the state, but on each citizen and child. Thus, education alone reflects the collaborative effort of those in power, the politicians, the lawmakers, the school boards, as well as all those involved, the teachers, the parents, the students.</p>
		<p>Yet incongruently, inexplicably, our children approach this goal not with enthusiasm, but with terror—not with pride, but with tedium. We may, with some merit, reason that our young insufficiently grasp the significance of their own academic performance, and indeed they shall not until adulthood fully understand its importance, but the unfortunate, inevitable truth is that education is never pleasant. The glamorous image of a student enraptured in a moment of understanding is but a fantasy. Academic success is a measure of the diligence and effort put forth by the student, not the teacher; learning is therefore attained not in a crucial moment of realization but in tireless repetition and memorization until the intuitive is indistinguishable from the dogmatic. Little wonder, then, that our students appear detached!</p>
		<p>Hence, our greatest priority is not to expand upon teaching, but to incentivize learning, which we accomplish so excellently by a game of numbers. Every educator is familiar with this game, and every student is a player, attached primarily because he has been told his performance in this game will control his future. In our system there are but winners and losers; and just as players in a game, like hyenas at a kill, know as if by instinct to hold their own gains in the highest regard, so do our students know that they may surmount a ruthlessly competitive global market only with ruthlessly impersonal dedication. We need not pressure our students to learn when they themselves do it so readily. See how they sacrifice everything to rise over their peers! Truly, the solution to the unpleasantry of education is control of the innermost vital emotion—competition, by which are driven all living things. The crux of this process is the standardized test. A test is a translation of the student’s total proficiency and understanding into a single number which can be manipulated algorithmically as any other number. This number, along with various other grades, speak for the student and represent his academic experiences. With the beauty of the test, we can pit any amount of students against each other and determine objectively the most intellectually gifted among them.</p>
		<p>Hence, given the success of our system otherwise, I propose a solution: Simply raise the minimum passing score in schools from seventy to ninety-five points, or from C to a high A, and increase the number of required academic courses. This, I believe, accords rationally with the arguments heretofore presented, and as such should not appear too drastic a change. It ensures a better education for those who need it most, the ones who can hardly graduate now, while leaving our most hardworking and successful students unaffected—for only under the conceivable threat of failure can our children collectively realize the importance of their academic performance in all areas—and effects, in the end, that each student enters the workforce or higher education on roughly equal ground. But to expect perfect passing rates under this system even from our most distinguished students, I realize, is unreasonable; therefore, lest our students should face exposure to a course for which they are not completely prepared, we shall have them repeat the course however many times necessary until they achieve that perfect score of ninety-five. This is how we shall resolve the paradox of American schooling, this is how we shall at last teach our young to retain knowledge: by beating it into them until their minds can no longer reject it.</p>
		<p>And if our students, in their second year of higher education, understand no more of differential calculus, cannot speak a word more of Latin, glean no more from Shakespeare, recall no more polyatomic compounds, and are no better informed of our political situation than in their second year of secondary education, we shall know it to be the fault of the students, for the numbers will show they knew the material well enough some time in-between.</p>
