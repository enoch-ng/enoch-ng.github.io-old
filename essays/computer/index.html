			<h2>Computer Music Composition Methods and Creativity</h2>
			<div id="content">
				<p class="summary">An essay I wrote in my freshman year of college regarding the potential of computer composition and its implications on ideas of creativity, unfortunately unpolished and unfinished due to time constraints.</p>
				<p>In his 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, Alan Turing famously introduced what is now known as the Turing Test, a straightforward approach to the question, “Can machines think?” Almost seventy years later, the question remains unanswered. Though the possibility of thinking machines seems distant, I believe the issue of computer creativity will be relevant much sooner. In this paper, I discuss current and future prospects of computer composition and how to reconcile the possibility of convincing computer-generated music with ideas of creativity and originality. Ultimately, I propose to consider a weakened form of the question: “Can machines be creative?” The problem of computer creativity, I believe, is analogous to that of computer thought in many ways. Common objections to the possibility of computer thought such as those described in Turing’s paper apply to computer creativity as well. This problem, as it were, is contingent on the following assumptions:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The ability to compose original music is indicative of creativity.</li>
					<li>The capability for machines to create compositions which are difficult to distinguish from human compositions is within reach.</li>
					<li>Creativity is an inherently human property, or at least requires some kind of “consciousness”.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>As such, this paradox is problematic only for those who, for example, might deny the possibility of computer creativity, just as Turing’s arguments are only troubling to those who deny the possibility of thinking machines. In this paper, I discuss the validity and rationale of each of these assumptions in relation to prospects of computer composition.</p>
				<p>Artificial intelligence research has progressed tremendously in the past decade, from the development of IBM’s Watson to AlphaGo’s victory against Lee Sedol in 2016. Problems thought traditionally to be very difficult such as image recognition and natural language processing have seen significant steps forward in part due to advancements in machine learning and artificial neural networks. Though none of these tasks are quite like that of music composition, they share the characteristic of being easy for humans but difficult for computers prior to specialized research and development. For the AI optimist, it is tempting to accept these accomplishments as proof of the inevitable rise of the computer musician&mdash;after all, surely even a task like algorithmic composition is of comparable difficulty to zero-shot translation with machine learning. However, this is hardly a convincing argument. To predict progress and potential stumbling blocks in the future of computer composition, it is helpful to review past and present approaches and evaluate their success.</p>
				<p>As an art form often bound by well-defined rules, music appears at first to be an essentially combinatorial problem, solvable by imposing constraints until the only remaining possibilities are flawless. In fact, in 1988, the IBM researcher Kemal Ebcioğlu attempted a solution for generating chorales in this manner, which resulted in a system comprising no less than 300 rules and was only sometimes successful. Though the attempt was significant, I believe a strictly rule-based approach might drastically complicate the problem of computer composition to the point of incoherence. Of the computer composition methods I considered, I was most impressed by DeepBach, a music composition model developed by Gaëtan Hadjeres and François Pachet at the Sony Computer Science Laboratories for generating four-part chorales in the style of J. S. Bach, either unconstrained or by harmonizing three voices to a given melody. DeepBach also allows for users to constrain the results by providing their own notes, rhythms, and cadences to be built upon, making the model potentially viable as a tool to assist composers in the creative process. The model is agnostic, meaning it requires no explicit knowledge of composition or music theory, but relies only on the training data to learn to produce original music.</p>
				<p>My own experiences with the music of DeepBach were surprisingly pleasant. Though the composition felt turgid and confused at times with frequent modulations which seemed mostly arbitrary and lacked a sense of purpose or structure, it impressed me with its ability to sustain coherent countermelodies and follow basic voice-leading principles most of the time. In fact, I find it reasonable that in general, those without musical training might find DeepBach’s compositions difficult to distinguish from Bach’s own. The experiments conducted by Hadjeres and Pachet seem to support my conclusion. After generating a large sample of compositions, the researchers presented them unidentified along with extracts from Bach’s own chorales, as well as extracts from a maximum entropy model and a multilayer perceptron model to a total of 1,272 listeners and asked them to judge whether the music was created by Bach or a computer. Results reflected favorably on the convincingness of DeepBach; about 50% of subjects believed that extracts composed by DeepBach were actually composed by Bach himself. Even listeners who identified as professional musicians or music composition students scored comparably poorly. To all but the most adamant skeptics toward the potential of artificial intelligence research, the success of Hadjeres and Pachet’s model is difficult to ignore.</p>
				<p>However, the impact of DeepBach should not be overstated. Impressive though the model is, researchers who wish to expand further on computer composition still have a long road ahead of them. Bach’s chorales have well-defined structures that simplify the task of generating them significantly. Current models fail to incorporate higher-level concepts such as form and motivic transformation and to create works of substantial length without losing coherence. Perhaps most importantly in the musician’s mind, generative models cannot draw inspiration from real-world phenomena or experiences, an obstacle which may not be overcome before the advent of general artificial intelligence. It is certainly possible that excepting some marginal improvements to existing models, these difficulties may present a “wall” which significantly impedes progress in this area for the immediate future.</p>
				<p>The most profound and evocative example of a difficult-to-emulate, high-level concept in music I can think of is the use of symbolism and harmonic suspension in Richard Wagner’s <cite>Tristan und Isolde</cite>. The first chord of the opera, so well-known among musicologists that it is commonly referred to as the “Tristan chord”, contains two dissonances which create a particularly strong desire for resolution, but the next chord resolves only one of these dissonances, providing a frustrating “half-resolution”. Throughout the opera this technique appears again and again, building up to resolutions that never arrive, creating a sense of longing and tension which comes to represent the titular characters’ love. Only on the last chord of the opera, which accompanies Isolde’s death, is this dissonance finally resolved. The message is clear: only in death can the two lovers be united for long. This kind of high-level symbolism would be extremely difficult or even impossible to achieve with current neural network models. We can certainly instruct a computer to employ some musical technique or other in a certain fashion, but it is unlikely this would result in anything novel; though the extreme use of harmonic suspension in <cite>Tristan</cite> is considered revolutionary for its time, the genius of the Tristan chord is in how it creates meaning within the context of the other musical elements. In an artificial neural network such as that employed by DeepBach, connecting musical techniques to real-world concepts such as love and separation would be completely infeasible. Of course, it is true that in real compositions, these high-level concepts are often lost on non-musicians, though the distinction is mostly beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
				<p>Now that we have viable candidates for aesthetically pleasing computer-generated music, we turn our attention to the inevitable question: what qualifies as music? After all, it can certainly be argued that the examples of computer-generated music we have reviewed thus far are not close enough to “real music” to merit consideration. In essence, we are asking, “What is music?” Note that a general definition might be too broad for our purposes. For example, most musicologists would surely agree that Schoenberg’s twelve-tone serial techniques qualify as music, but I suspect that few would accept a program that generates Schoenberg-like pieces as proof that computers can create. Indeed, computer composition may not ever be taken seriously until its results rival the works of such composers as Mozart and Bach, just as computer chess players were not given much thought until Deep Blue defeated Kasparov. In short, for computer composers to be creative beyond a reasonable doubt, they must not only compose music, they must also compose music greater than what has ever been heard before.</p>
				<p>Suppose, then, we have a music composition model whose works put Bach and Mozart to shame. Suppose also that the authenticity of these works is so high that it consistently fools even professional musicologists. In this scenario, I am tempted to conclude that the model exhibits creativity beyond a reasonable doubt for the sole fact of its musical achievements, but I can anticipate several possible objections to this claim. Hence, we must reconsider our original assumption that the ability to compose original music is a sufficient condition for creativity before we may apply it. For the sake of relatability, let us suppose that our “superhuman composer” functions similarly to DeepBach. Probably critical musicologists would be quick to note that while DeepBach is relatively competent at writing four-part chorales in the style of J. S. Bach, it has no capacity whatsoever to perform other tasks. The methodology behind DeepBach’s design might turn out to be of limited use as well; for example, it would almost certainly translate poorly, if at all, to opera writing and film scoring. Unfortunately, I have no response to objections of this variety, because they raise valid concerns.</p>
				<p>We must also consider an issue slightly more philosophical in nature, the relation between the external appearance of some abstract property and the verifiable existence of that property. This issue is best known in artificial intelligence research in relation to consciousness, but it is pertinent to creativity as well. In essence, it is possible that “creative” tasks such as music composition are not totally indicative of creativity, because the appearance of creativity is not a sufficient condition for the existence of creativity itself. In this case, it would be infeasible for artificial intelligence researchers to demonstrate the creative ability of machines by designing sufficiently convincing music composition models, though it is worth noting that by this definition, in a strict sense, nothing can be shown to be creative.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, if we do require evidence that the creativity of computer composers is not merely superficial, we would do well to ascertain how “deep” the indicators of creativity must go. In his 1979 Pulitzer prize-winning book <cite>Gödel, Escher, Bach</cite>, the cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter, on the topic of whether the programmer or the computer should receive credit for computer-generated music, argues that in most circumstances, “the driving force &hellip; is human intellect” and that the computer serves as “a tool for realizing an idea devised by the human”, but concedes that attributing computer compositions to computers makes sense if and when computers gain the capability for “perspective on what [they are] doing” and sense of self. In a later chapter, Hofstadter also claims that “a ‘program’ which could produce music as [Chopin or Bach] did would have to wander around the world on its own, fighting its way through the maze of life and feeling every moment of it. &hellip; Part and parcel of it would have to be a sense of grace, humor, rhythm, a sense of the unexpected—and of course an exquisite awareness of the magic of fresh creation”. Now we have reached a small dilemma; while it is clear that computers have not and likely will not attain these attributes in the near future, advancements in artificial neural networks have made it possible for programmers with only very general compositional knowledge to create programs that can compose convincing music. Additionally, it might be argued that in a narrow sense, an artificial neural network trained to compose music makes autonomous decisions which eventually determine the placement and duration of notes in a way that more closely resembles processes of the human brain than Hofstadter might have anticipated. These “decisions”, of course, never occur to the programmer. In this case, the question of who deserves the credit is not so simple. Clearly the resulting compositions cannot be totally attributed to the programmer, because he provides no knowledge of composition except in the form of training data which he did not create. To attribute the work to the computer, on the other hand, is essentially an admittance of computer creativity, a drastic leap to make. Certainly, no computer has ever wandered its way around the world and thought to describe its experiences in a sonata, but unless we are willing to allow that a piece of music may have no composer at all, it seems inevitable that we will have to grant at least some credit to computers who compose original music.</p>
				<p>The most practical benefit of further research in this field would, of course, probably not be the philosophical implications it presents, but the potential for cheap, original music available for filmmakers and game developers on short notice. Besides the practical benefit of computer composers, however (which, from a musician’s perspective, is more concerning than it is exciting), the greatest advantage of a convincing composition model for artificial intelligence researchers would be that it presented one more refutation of the “argument from disability”, which, as Turing explains in his paper, expresses the belief that there is always some task that is viable for humans, but impossible for machines. In a Princeton lecture two years before the publication of Turing’s paper, the mathematician John von Neumann reportedly said, “You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!” An algorithmic or generative composition model whose results rivaled the works of Bach and Mozart would surely silence some claims regarding the limits of machines. As for the impact of the problem, it hardly needs arguing that the ability for musical creativity is artistically and philosophically significant. Compositions such as Bach’s <cite>Mass in B minor</cite> have been hailed as some of the greatest works produced by mankind; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, one of the great German poets of the Romantic era, was greatly influenced by classical music and compared Mozart’s genius to that of Shakespeare and Rafael. In <cite>The World as Will and Representation</cite>, the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer called music “the most powerful of all the arts” and additionally wrote: “Because music does not, like all the other arts, exhibit the <i>Ideas</i> or grades of the will’s objectification, but directly the <i>will itself</i>, we can also explain that it acts directly on the will, i.e. the feelings, passions, and emotions of the hearer, so that it quickly raises these or even alters them”. The importance of computer composers is potentially greater than artificial intelligence research in any other form of art.</p>
				<p>With recent advances in machine learning techniques opening up the possibility for more convincing computer composition models, the philosophical implications of music-creating machines are quickly becoming relevant. Though the era of general artificial intelligence still seems remote, computer composers may not be; already, generative models such as DeepBach show promising results in the way of fooling listeners of their authenticity, prompting AI researchers, musicians, and philosophers alike to contemplate what it means to be creative. In the meantime, researchers still have much to consider if they want their creations to compete with the likes of Bach and Mozart, particularly concerning the integration of high-level concepts such as meaning and form in music. It is possible that such challenges may significantly impede development of music composition models in the future prior to major breakthroughs in other areas of artificial intelligence research, though this is not a particularly strong argument against the plausibility of computer creativity. In any case, the development of convincing composition models raises questions not only about what we consider to be music, but also about what we consider to be indicative of creativity.</p>
