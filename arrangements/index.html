			<h2>Arrangements</h2>
			<div id="content">
				<p>Arranging and transcribing music has been a hobby of mine for many years. I usually arrange music from video games and anime, though I'll end up arranging anything if I like it enough. Although most of my arrangements are probably too niche to be listed here, I have uploaded those that I think people might find useful.</p>
				<ul class="work-list">
					<li>
						<p class="work-title"><i>Hacking to the Gate</i> by Chiyomaru Shikura</p>
						<p class="work-info">Instrumentation: Cello and Piano</p>
						<p class="work-desc">Tuturu! This arrangement of <i>Hacking to the Gate</i>, the opening song to the popular anime <i>Steins;Gate</i>, was originally a request from a friend who wanted to play it on his euphonium. Since then, it's undergone many revisions, but I've tried to keep the arrangement mostly loyal to the original song.</p>

						<p class="work-title"><i>Megalovania</i> by Toby Fox</p>
						<p class="work-info">Instrumentation: String Quartet</p>
						<p class="work-desc">This is probably the most well-known track from <i>Undertale</i> besides <i>Death by Glamour</i>. This one actually started out as an arrangement for alto and tenor saxophones, cello, and electric bass&mdash;quite the eclectic instrumentation. Fortunately, only minimal changes were needed to rewrite it for string quartet. In this arrangement, I tried to capture the energy and movement of the original as much as possible.</p>
